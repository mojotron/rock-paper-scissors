# Rock Paper Scissors

This project is part of [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/) curriculum. The assignment was to make the classic game of Rock Paper Scissors. This was more design challenge then coding one. Making a simple game like this, to pop out and look appealing is very difficult. In no time, you add to many stuff. Relax and just make it simple.

## What have I learned:

- Use of dataset attribute - is searching how to take input from player. Dataset attribute came out as a perfect solution for the problem. It's an easy way to get user choice for game decisions.
- Simple design principles - as I started to code I forgot about my plan and game design I have drawn on a piece of paper. In HTML file, I have put the structure for to many elements. I have removed them after I saw how the page looked cluttered (high score, round log, images for player, computer). Minimalist design looked satisfying.
- Document JS with comments - after I finished implementing the game logic, everything was working. But code looked like mess so I refactored it and gave comments to more abstract parts. Next time I'll go with pseudocode approach before writing code to have a clear picture of what to do.
- Naming functions - naming functions is hard. Giving short description of what it is doing is even harder. I learned that different naming in HTML, CSS, and JS files for the same functionality makes you search for bugs a lot more then needed. Example of bad naming - Html class name player-display and js selector userDisplay.
- One action per function - solving problems by making it in sub problems is game changer.
- Group repeating styles - making css file with DRY principle in mind.
- user-select: none - with fast clicking on input divs other elements on the page got highlighted and this declaration did the trick.
